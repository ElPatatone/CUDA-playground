## What is this?
This is the start of a long journey into the world of parallel computing using `GPUs`. 

I plan to share my research and findings publicly.

### Navigation:
- [CUDA Kernels](cuda-kernels/)
(*Practical CUDA programming examples.*)
- [RTX 2060 breakdown](gpu-architecture/rtx2060/) 
(*Deep dive into GPU hardware architecture, using the RTX 2060 as that is what I own 
right now.*)
